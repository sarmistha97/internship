        The term whale can be used in reference to any cetacean, including porpoises and dolphins,
        but in general it is applied to those more than 3 metres (10 feet) long.
        Whales roam throughout all of the world's oceans, communicating with complex and mysterious sounds.
        Their sheer size amazes us: the blue whale can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and weigh up to 
        200 tonsâ€”as much as 33 elephants.
        Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young.
        A thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters.
