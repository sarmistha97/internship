        The term whale can be used in reference to any cetacean, including porpoises and dolphins,
        but in general it is applied to those more than 3 metres (10 feet) long.
        Whales roam throughout all of the world's oceans, communicating with complex and mysterious sounds.
        Their sheer size amazes us: the blue whale can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and weigh up to 
        200 tons—as much as 33 elephants.
        Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young.
        A thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters.
